Piface inputs:
---------------
P1 -> product 1 : Diesel
P2 -> product 2 : B20
P3 -> product 3 : B50
P4 -> product 4 : B100

Nozzle1 -> Diesel
Nozzle2 -> BioDiesel


Piface Relays:
--------------
In series with the pump relays.
Normally open (disabled).

Other Piface related stuff:
-----------------------------
There is a jumper next to relay one. It is tieing the pi supply line to piface supply.
Inputs are pulled up to 3.3V VDD with a 100K resistor.
There is an unknown currnet limiting resistor in series as well.

thePi - intercepting dispenser LCD data:
----------------------------------------
P1.11 to Clock
P1.15 to Data
P1.16 to Latch

P1 is the largest port on the pi.
Pin 1 of the port is marked with a little bracket to its left.

keypad
------------------
Usb encoder board connects to the keypad with a ribbon cable.
I marked the header on the board with red ink. The red stripe goes on that side.
There is a usb cable to connect the encoder board to the pi.
